# PIL-dimensions

Add a bit more versatility to an already versatile module, allowing the user to dimension drawings, with antialiasing as required and add dashed lines.
For those in a hurry and your python version is newer than 3.7, use the module DimLinesDC which requires a dataclass, otherwise use the module
DimLinesAA which is very similar. If antialiasing is not necessary use the module DimLinesPIL. All modules with annotations are found in the **scripts** directory.
